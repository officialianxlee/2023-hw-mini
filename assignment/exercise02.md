# Exercise 02 - deterministic code

[Exercise Python script](./exercise02.py)

[Exercise 02 Questions](#questions)

A common task in embedded systems is to repeat a task many times with a precise enough time interval.
Since we expect deterministic execution, there should be little variance in time to execute vs. what happens on a non-real-time system such as full Raspberry Pi with a non-real-time operating system or a laptop computer.
However, if the task is waiting on communication, IO or has random time delay, the execution time will vary.

Here we measure elapsed time, but add hardware in the loop.
This example runs only on the Pico as it uses the "machine" MicroPython module.

Note: to transfer files such as
[exercise02.json](./exercise02.json)
to the Pico, use Thonny IDE "View - Files".
Then in the "Files" top window for "This Computer", navigate to the file to copy to the Pico.
Right click that file, and select "Upload to /" to copy the file to the Pico.

In this exercise, copy both "exercise02.py" and "exercise02.json" to the Pico so that the Pico can load the parameter file without relying on the computer.
Edit / run the exercise02.py script on the Pico -- with Thonny this is done from the Files tab by right-clicking exercise02.py and selecting "open in Thonny".
Thonny shows tab "[exercise02.py]" where the brackets `[]` indicate the file is remote on the Pico.

To download a file that you've edited on the Pico back to your computer to upload to Git, in Thonny Files tab, right-click the file on the Pico and select "Download to ..." where "..." is the directory on your computer to save the file.

## Questions

### Question 01

Why do you think we would use a file (e.g. JSON file) for parameter storage instead of accepting the parameters as user `input()`, especially on an embedded system?

Answer: We use a file for parameter storage instead of accepting the parameters as user 'input(); especially in embedded systems because files allow for consistency and reusability, security such as storing API keys, flexibility, ease of maintenance if certain parameters need to be updated, performance since embedded systems often have startup configurations that are read from a file during boot time, testing, and user experience.

### Question 02

Why might we prefer to use a JSON file to store parameters instead of hard-coding values in the Python script?

Answer: We prefer to use a JSON file to store parameters instead of hard-coding values in the Python script for code organization, cleaner code, and security issues when dealing with sensitive data.

### Question 03

Why didn't the exercise02.py code use
[os.path.isfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isfile),
that is, why did I write the "is_regular_file()" function?

Answer: The is_regular_file() function was created to provide a way to check if a file is a regular file that works in both MicroPython and standard Python environments, allowing for code that is portable between these two environments since the "os.path.isfile()" method does not exist in the MicroPython environment. This function leverages the available functionalities in each environment to perform the file check, ensuring the script can run correctly regardless of the Python environment it is executed in.
